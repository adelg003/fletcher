# Fletcher
Fletcher is a proof of concert where in memory graphs are used to orchestrate the triggering of
    compute jobs.
With its precise orchestration, your data products won’t rush or drag — no one can say "Not quite
    my tempo."

# Why is this repo called Fletcher?
This repo is named after Terence Fletcher, who was the world ~~infamous~~ famous conductor of the
    Shaffer Studio Jazz Band at the Shaffer Conservatory in New York City.
